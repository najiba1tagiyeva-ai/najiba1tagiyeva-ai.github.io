            <p class="section-text">
                Azerbaijan is widely known for its dependence on oil and gas, but in recent years the country has announced ambitious plans to expand renewable energy and reduce emissions. As the global energy system moves toward cleaner technologies, understanding whether Azerbaijan is genuinely progressing becomes increasingly important. This project uses data from 1990–2024 to analyze long-term trends in energy production, carbon emissions, and regional comparison. Through visualizations, it evaluates how the country's energy dependence has evolved, what structural challenges persist, and what opportunities exist for diversifying the energy mix.

                <p>
                    Azerbaijan's energy landscape remains heavily shaped by fossil fuels. Oil production peaked in the late 2000s and has declined since, while natural gas production has risen steadily, becoming the dominant source after 2018. This shift represents a transition within fossil fuels rather than away from them, as renewable share remains too small to alter the overall picture.

                <p>
                    Azerbaijan's post-Soviet period showed high carbon intensity: large emissions despite small GDP. From the early 2000s, GDP grew rapidly while emissions increased slower, suggesting relative decoupling. However, full decoupling has not occurred—economic growth still drives incremental CO₂ increases, as renewables and efficiency remain too limited to significantly alter trajectory.

                    Renewable energy is growing but remains modest. Hydropower provides most renewable output, though its potential is limited. Recent increases stem from solar and wind projects developed through international investments after 2020. While capacity expands, current scale remains too small to influence the national energy mix.

                    The matrix reveals negative correlations: electricity use (-0.62), population (-0.44), and GDP (-0.15). This counterintuitive pattern shows economic growth drives fossil fuel consumption rather than renewable diversification, as abundant domestic hydrocarbons provide cheap energy.

                    Using linear regression (R² = 0.54), we predict renewable share based on GDP, population, and electricity consumption. The model captures general patterns but significant deviations exist, indicating external factors—policy, investment, infrastructure—play substantial roles. Under current trends, renewable share will reach only 5–7% by 2030.

                    Geographic distribution reveals strategic concentration: liberated Karabakh territories (solar/hydro), mountainous regions (small hydro), and Caspian coast (wind). Most operational capacity comes from Soviet-era plants (Mingachevir: 424 MW), while new projects represent recent diversification. Technical potential in Karabakh (7,200 MW solar, 2,000 MW wind) remains largely untapped.

                    Azerbaijan's 2030 renewable target substantially exceeds current pipeline, with in-development capacity concentrated in solar while wind remains underdeveloped. Comparison with Georgia and Armenia shows targets are ambitious but achievable—however, closing the gap requires dramatically accelerated deployment rates.

            <p class="section-text">
                Azerbaijan stands at a critical juncture. While hydrocarbons dominate, renewable capacity is expanding slowly. The analysis reveals a fundamental tension: oil and gas wealth fueled growth but reduced diversification urgency. Unlike resource-poor Georgia (25.2%) and Armenia (9.1%), Azerbaijan remains at 1.3% despite higher GDP. Progress exists—new projects emerge in liberated territories, international investment gradually increases—but the gap between targets and deployment remains wide. Machine learning suggests current trends yield only 5–7% by 2030. Economic growth correlates with increased fossil consumption, not renewable adoption. Geographic distribution reveals vast Karabakh potential (7,200 MW solar, 2,000 MW wind) but realizing this requires regulatory reform, infrastructure investment, and sustained policy commitment. Azerbaijan's transition will not occur through market forces alone—cheap gas and oil crowd out renewables without intervention. Success requires breaking fossil dependency through carbon pricing, subsidy reform, international partnerships, and capacity building.

                <p>World Bank API provides broad indicators but lacks granular detail on project timelines, generation output, and sub-national patterns. Some capacity data—particularly small hydro and rooftop solar—may be incomplete. The ML model (R² = 0.54) shows socioeconomic variables alone cannot fully explain trajectories.</p>
